- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Shoe91a
  This is the start of a Home Lab project to showcase and keep track of my accomplishments and changes to this system.

  Keep an eye on the changelog and very VERY close friends will be invited for future endeavors.
  I'm hoping by keeping a detailed writeup i can catalog my methods and actions, faults and recoveries so in the future someone can utilize this
  without fear of "oh, thanks guys, but i figured it out" and recieve nothing lol.
